      <h1>Some of My Hobbies</h1>
      <p>Hello fellow internet readers, my name is Robert and I would like to tell you about some
      of the hobbies that I have.</p>
      <p>Lets start with gaming as my first hobbie. It started when I was a little kid that my first games
      I played was "Mario Bros". I am sure that a lot of you may have started or remembered this game, this
      was were it all started. From there on I have gone threw a lot of games and consoles, one that has always
      stuck was "Golden Eye" for the N64. Now we have gone threw many systems and many more games, we are in a
      time were they are getting more realistic and it is a game to see which game will last the longest before
      we turn to the next one.</p>
      <p>With this said, I have been playing a game called "Rainbow Six Siege" this game has been one that I have played for a year now.
      The reason I have been so hooked on the game is because it is a first person shooter that you need tactics and communication with
      your team/players to succed. Granted this game may be a lot of kill the other team and do it again, but the tactical aspect makes it great.</p>
      <p>Another hobby of mine is Photography, this has been a recently new thing for me. I started it like 2 years ago and it was not until last
      year that I got more into it and improving on my pictures. I love taking landscape shots mostly during the night or sunset, the reason I have
      chosen to do night photography is because there are a lot of people that don't know how beautiful the world is at night.
      I will show some of my work in this blog, I really hope you like the shots. If you would like to see the gameplay click on the link and see for
      yourself <a href="https://rainbow6.ubi.com/siege/en-us/home/index.aspx">Rainbow Six Siege.</a></p>
      <p>I hope you have enjoyed the little blog of mine, I will be adding more of my hobbies later on.</p>
